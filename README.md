## Description
This easy-to-use budget app tracks incoming and outgoing payments and, via IndexedDB, will track online and offline activity. Expenditures appear in a table at the top of the page and a Chart.js chart tracks total monies via a graph.

## Installation
Deployed on Heroku with the MLab add-on, this app also uses the following packages:

* Mongoose
* Morgan (logger)
* Express

## Usage

Upon opening the app in Heroku (https://serene-sierra-06030.herokuapp.com/), the user will see a blank table and a blank graph, unless they have previously accessed and entered information into the database. Once information has been entered, the app will look like this:

To enter a new payment or expense, simply type the identifying information into the first box ("new clothes," "groceries," "payday") and click on "Add Funds" or "Subtract Funds" as appropriate.
